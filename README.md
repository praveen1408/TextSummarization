# TextSummarization
Using LDA.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used for classifying documents using Latent Semantic Analysis. 
If we consider each line in a text file as one document, then we can classify all the lines of the document using this unsupervised learning method. 
Then we pick the most polar or radical lines from each topic. These k lines should encompass all the main points in the document. 
Hence an extractive summarizer is constructed.
